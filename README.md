##  Project Overview

This project analyzes **Eduvos Graduate Survey data** to identify the most popular:

* Programming Languages
* Databases
* Cloud Platforms
* Web Frameworks
* AI Search Tools
* AI Developer Tools
* Industries and Job Roles
* Employment Trends by Study Field

While graduates are primarily from **IT, Software Development, and Financial Services**, this analysis also demonstrates how their skills can be applied in the **Mining sector**:

* **Programming & Data Science tools** (Python, R, SQL) → support **mineral exploration, predictive maintenance, and plant optimization**
* **Cloud platforms** (AWS, Azure, GCP) → enable **mining simulations and IoT analytics**
* **AI tools** (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, ML libraries) → power **automation in safety monitoring, geological modeling, and decision-making**

Results are delivered in an **interactive R Shiny dashboard**, helping Eduvos align its IT curriculum with **real industry trends**, including mining.

##  Relevance to Mining

This dashboarding approach can be applied to mining for:

1. **Workforce & Skills Analysis** – monitor IT/data skills in mining staff
2. **Technology Adoption Tracking** – IoT, predictive maintenance, automation
3. **Industry Benchmarking** – digital twins, GIS, safety monitoring
4. **Employment Trends** – workforce structure, AI/cloud talent demand
5. **Decision Dashboards** – real-time data for HR and executives

 In short: the **Eduvos skills survey analysis** also maps directly to **mining workforce readiness and digital transformation**.
